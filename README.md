# AllowanceCalculator
An Android Application that helps you manage your money.


The problem that I had is:
I have X amount of money that should cover me for Y amount of days.


what I do is that I divide X by Y to give myself an allowance... and I keep track of everything I spend or receive using notes on my cell phone.

This app was created just to automate this process.
I tell it the X amount of money that I have.
I tell it the Y days that should be covered.
it tells me my allowance.
whenever I spend money I tell the app.
whenever I receive money I tell the app.
whenever I spend more that I should, the app recalculates X/Y which makes my allowance less.


I'd imagine it looks something like this:


![Alt text](/readmephotos/image.jpg?raw=true "1")
![Alt text](/readmephotos/image2.jpg?raw=true "2")
![Alt text](/readmephotos/image3.jpg?raw=true "3")


that's it.
